# Paths
lsof                                    # list open files
cd                                      # change to the home directory
cd ..                                   # chagne to the directory up
cd -                                    # return to the previous directory

# File manipulation
xxd -b hello.txt                        # see hello.txt in binary form
xxd hello.txt                           # see hello.txt in hexadecimal form
hexdump -C hello.txt                    # see hello.txt in hexadecimal form, same with xxd 'hello.txt'

# Shell script
export PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH              # prepend '/opt/bin' to $PATH

# Vagrant
vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64            # initializes a trusty64 vagrant box
vagrant up                              # start the vagrant machine in the current directory
vagrant ssh                             # enters the virtual machine in the current directory using ssh
vagrant halt                            # shut down the machine in the current directory
vagrant destroy                         # destroy the machine
vagrant reload                          # 'vagrant halt' and then 'vagrant up'

# System monitoring
ps                                      # report a snapshot of the current processes
ps aux                                  # see every process on the system
top                                     # dynamic view of processes
htop                                    # fancy version of 'top'
dstat -am                               # generate system resource statistics, -a for all but memory and -m for memory

# Github
git add hello.txt                       # add hello.txt to the commit
git add -A                              # add all changed files to the commit
git commit -m "my commit"               # commit with message "my commit"
git push origin master                  # push 'master' branch to 'origin' repo
git reset [--soft] HEAD~1               # discard the local commits that are not pushed
git reset --hard <some_commit>          # discard all the changes and go to the state of <some_commit>
